# MarkovChains

This is the GitHub repository for our group project in the Freie Universit√§t Berlin's lecture [Markov Chains and Markov Models](http://www.mi.fu-berlin.de/w/CompMolBio/MarkovKetten15) in summer term 2015.
Group members are:

Our MarkovChains software aims to be an easy to use and maintainable, open source solution to generate Markov 
models from given time series.
